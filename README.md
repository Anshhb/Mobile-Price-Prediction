## Mobile Price Prediction

Developed and optimized a mobile price prediction model using various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, KNN, Regression Tree, and Neural Network. Evaluated model performance to identify the most accurate approach and applied it to predict prices on a custom dataset of mobiles.

### Key Features

- **Algorithms Used**: Linear Regression, KNN, Regression Tree, Neural Network
- **Techniques**: Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Custom Dataset**: Created and used a self-made dataset for prediction

### Results

- Achieved high accuracy in price prediction with the most effective model.
